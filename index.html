      <h3>Help You And Your Team Grow</h3>
      <p class = "pmain">
        A great way to build a product is to have a leader in place with
        deep skills in several areas and a broad range of experiece to help your
        teams grow.
        I have 10+ years experience working in a variety of software roles
        including business analyst, developer, tester, agile project manager,
        and product manager, so i understand how these roles can come together
        to successfully build and manage a digital product.

      <h3>Keep It Going</h3>
      <p class = "pmain">
        It's important to understand product lifecycle and drive innovation.
        I previously worked as a consultant where I helped the FDIC manage one of
        its key programs. As the program matured I led an effort to introduce a
        new portfolio management strategy.

        It saved them an estimated $105
        million.
